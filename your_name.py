    the following:

    "Hello firstname lastname! You just delved into python."

INPUT FORMAT:
    The first line contains the first name, and the second line contains the last name.

    Print the output as mentioned above.

def print_full_name(a, b):
    print(f"Hello {a.title()} {b.title()}! You just delved into python.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    first_name = input()
    last_name = input()
    print_full_name(first_name, last_name)


"""
EXPLANATION: 
    'first_name' is parameter 'a', and 'last_name' is parameter 'b', so I simply replaced 'firstname' and 
    'lastname' from the required output string using an f string (and added .title() just in case the user
    didn't use capitalization).
